# C++ Reference

A page on many of the various "hacks" that one can do in c++.
I am not very knowledgable on any of these, so I'll include some specific things I have run into in the past.

```cpp
next_permutation(str1.begin(), str2.end());
//useful in rearranging strings to the next lexigraphical permutations.
```
Bitwise operators:
```cpp
& // bitwise AND
| // bitwise OR
^ // bitwise XOR
a << b // bitwise shifts a by b bits to the left (repeated *2 of the num)
a >> b // bitwiswe shifts a by b bits to the right (repeated halving of num)
```
